# Overview
## Project: Basic Inventory System

This project is part of my learning in software development, applying concepts and syntax of the C++ language. Through the creation of an inventory management application, I explored and implemented principles of object-oriented programming, manipulation of data structures (such as vectors and lists) and data persistence using plain text files.

## Software Description

The Basic Inventory System application is a command line program designed to manage the inventory of items for a user.
It allows users to:

- **View all existing items in inventory:** Displays all items stored in the text file in a user-readable format.
- **Add new items:** Allows users to enter and store new items, including name, quantity and price.
- **Delete items:** Allows users to remove items from their collection by specifying the name of the item.
- **Search items:** Allows users to search specific items in inventory by name, displaying their details.

# Development Environment
## Tools
- **VS Code:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for C++ development, providing code editing, debugging and project management.
- **MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows):** A set of development tools that allows you to compile and run GNU software on Windows, including the g++ compiler.
- **Git:** Version control system used to track changes and manage the projectâ€™s source code.

## Programming Language and Libraries
- **C++:** The main programming language used to develop the application. 
- **C++ Standard Library (STL):** Used for manipulation of strings, data structures (such as vectors and lists) and input/output operations.
- **File Handling (fstream):** C++ standard library used for reading and writing inventory data in plain text files, allowing the persistence of data between program runs.

# Future Work

- **Item Editing:** Add the ability to edit existing items, allowing users to modify name, quantity and price.
- **Implement Item Ordering:** Add the ability to sort inventory items by name, quantity or price.
- **Implement Database:** Replace the text file with a database to improve application scalability and performance.
